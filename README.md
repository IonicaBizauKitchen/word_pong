To Do
-----

* When resorting to a random word response, ensure the random word is an adjective
* Keep Pings within a certain level of accessibility (corpus frequency)
* Add an "I Don't Know" option
* Anagram mode
* Add a "Gimme a hint" option
* update layout centering when switching play modes
* Store the blacklist in a cookie (maybe ezcookie supports arrays?), not a param.
